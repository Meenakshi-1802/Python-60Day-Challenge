## 🐍 60 Days Python Learning Journey 🚀

Hey! I'm **Meenakshi**, an aspiring **Data Scientist / Data Analyst**.  
Although I’ve already learned the basics of Python, I’m starting this **60 Days Python Learning Journey** to **master it deeply** and **brush up my coding skills**. This journey is a solid step toward strengthening my Data Science foundation.

As part of this challenge, I will upload:

✅ Day-wise **PPTs**  
✅ Short **Notes / DOCX summaries**  
✅ Daily **Python code and exercises**

---

## 📌 Why This Journey?

This learning journey is part of my bigger **Data Science roadmap**. Python is the core of data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.  
Through this challenge, I aim to:

- Master Python with consistent practice  
- Build a strong coding habit  
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Prepare better for **real-world data projects**

## 📁 What's Inside?

Every day has its own folder:  
`Day01`, `Day02`, ..., up to `Day60`

Each folder contains:

- `ppt/` → Daily concept slides  
- `notes/` → DOCX summaries or key points  
- `code/` → Python files for practice and tasks
